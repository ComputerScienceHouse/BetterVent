# What is it?
BetterVent is a lightweight, open source, customizable android app that shows the status of conference rooms.
It has three main functions:
- Display the current event happening in a room as well as when the next event is
- Show a week-view interface of events for the next seven days
- A quick-mode function for ad-hoc events. Has an editable title field, as well as a name-list for queuing or attendance purposes

# How do I get it?
Currently, BetterVent is not on the Play Store, but you can download the .apk file in the top directory of this repo.
(I'll try to keep it up to date)

# Future Features
- UI Fixes
- Settings panel to customize colors
- Kiosk mode to prevent users from leaving the app
- Ability to only display events at a certain location
